# ZEP; Spoken Sentence Identification
## Description:

Purpose of this ZEP experiment is to measure a participant's ability
to identify (speech) sounds. For each trial a sound is presented.
Participant's task is to jugdge whether a prespecified property is
present in the stimulus or not. In this case it is if a sentence
is negative or positive. Experiment is self-paced, has visual
appealing features, and auditory instruction (Dutch).

Reaction time is measured from the `critical_word_onset` of the `critical_word`.
This onset time needs to be defined per audio file in the input lists.

## Output: chosen value.

## Pseudo randomisation
Stimuli are build up out of pairs. Each pair either carries a negative
or a positive type of critical word. Randomisation is such that there are never
more than 3 pairs in a row with the same type of critical word.

## Installing and starting
* Download and install zep (1.12) [here](http://beexy.org/zep/wiki) for either Windows OS or a Debian based Linux OS.
* Download and unpack this repository
* Run either `windows-terminal.bat` or `linux-terminal.sh` to start up a _command-line interface_ within the unpacked repository
* You can then start up the experiment by typing: `zep ident_pn` or `zep-1.12 ident_pn`

## About Zep
Zep is a system for implementing and running (psycholinguistic) experiments. Zep delivers auditory, visual and cross modal stimuli, and provides interfacing with external hardware such as eye-trackers and button boxes. It is based on a multipurpose programming language (also called Zep) which enables you to implement not only experiments but other applications as well.
