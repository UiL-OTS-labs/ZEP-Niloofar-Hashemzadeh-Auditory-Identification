## About Zep
Zep is a system for implementing and running (psycholinguistic) experiments. Zep delivers auditory, visual and cross modal stimuli, and provides interfacing with external hardware such as eye-trackers and button boxes. It is based on a multipurpose programming language (also called Zep) which enables you to implement not only experiments but other applications as well.
